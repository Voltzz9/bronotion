### 1. Introduction

Introduction

This report documents the development process and outcomes of Project 2 for Computer Science 343. Our group developed Bronotion, a real-time collaborative note-taking web application, which is publicly hosted at bronotion.co.za. This app allows users to create and manage markdown-based notes, with additional features such as PDF downloads of markdown files and Google/GitHub sign-in support. 
 
We built Bronotion using React.js and Tailwind CSS for the front end, with a backend powered by Node.js and PostgreSQL. We implemented authentication mechanisms with both traditional login managed by us through our database and OAuth-based options for Google and GitHub.

This report includes:

Use case diagrams to illustrate the key user interactions within Bronotion.
Data models and database structures normalized to 3NF or BCNF to ensure data integrity.
A detailed explanation of authentication mechanisms, focusing on the differences between authentication (authn) and authorization (authz).
A high-level overview of design patterns employed for both the front-end and API layers.
A summary of Git practices, including branching strategies and individual contributions tracked through commits.
